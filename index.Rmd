## Compulsory Activity

1. **Two group presentations in front of the class.**  
   All group members need to be active and present during both presentations. Group size is restricted to 3-4 students, but students can ask for an exemption if they want to work in smaller/larger groups. Students also need to hand in slides for each presentation. The slides need to be comprehensive.

2. **Participation in four mandatory online surveys.**  
   The online surveys will be administered during class. The surveys will, among other things, include multiple choice questions on concepts covered in class. The surveys will give a pass/fail grade. It is necessary to pass at least 3 out of the 4 online surveys to get a course approval. The course approval is only valid for one semester.

## Assessment

The assessment is based on the final paper, and will be written in the same groups as with the presentations. The paper is due four weeks after the final presentation (i.e., Friday December 12; to be uploaded on WISEflow by 12.00 this day) and must be written in English. The paper is graded on the standard scale (A--F). Each group member gets the same grade.

## Course Overview

This website covers the essential tools needed to work with AI and Large Language Models at a basic level, mostly through the use of APIs. You'll learn:

- **Python Programming**: Essential Python skills for AI and data analysis
- **LLM Fundamentals**: Understanding how language models work under the hood
- **API Integration**: Working with commercial and open-source LLM APIs
- **LangChain Framework**: Building sophisticated AI applications
- **Practical Applications**: Real-world projects including data scraping, analysis, and automation

## Getting Started

To get the most out of this course:

1. Set up a Python environment (we recommend Google Colab for beginners)
2. Follow along with the code examples
3. Complete the hands-on exercises
4. Experiment with variations of the examples
